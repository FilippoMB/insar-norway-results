Semi-supervised learning combines sparse human annotations with the spatial and temporal structure of InSAR data. This section collects experiments where unlabeled observations borrow strength from neighbours to improve classification fidelity.

- [Graph-based SSL Method]({{ '/semi-supervised-learning/ss-method/' | relative_url }}) details the current pipeline for propagating labels and handling confidence thresholds.

Future additions can include alternative graph constructions or pseudo-labelling strategies. Use the navigation sidebar to jump into the available report.
